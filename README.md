# wegener-expedition-data

This repository accompanies our publication "On the potential of the historic expedition material from the Wegener
Greenland Expedition for modern Glaciological Research" by Aberman et al., currently under review in Scientific Reports.

## Data

The main part of the repository is data collected by the 1929-1931 Alfred Wegener Greenland expedition.

### Original Books

The original data from the expedition was published in 7 books (one of which is split into 2 parts). Scanned versions of
these books are in the folder
in ```original-books```.
The PDFs were processed with optical character recognition (OCR) software, but be aware that for some parts
(especially tables) this did not always work well. The OCR information is, however, only additional to the scanned
pages, so by hand all data can be extracted.

### Digitized

Part of the data was digitized into standard data formats (.csv). The folder ```data/digitized``` contains that digitized
data. The original data description (variables etc.) is in German, for the digitzed data everything was translated to English.
All date formats were changed to YYYY-mm-dd.

Files:

- ```eismitte-soundings.csv```: vertical soundings made with balloons at the Eismitte (EM) station
